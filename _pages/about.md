I’m **Boyi Yuan**, a third-year PhD student in Economics at University of Calgary.  
My research interests are energy & environmental economics, applied econometrics, and behavioral economics. Specifically, I'm focusing on individuals' behavioural responses to energy price changes. 

In Fall 2025, I’m organizing reading groups with fellow VPs of the Economics Graduate Association at University of Calgary. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in it.
